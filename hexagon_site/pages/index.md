The Hexagon toolkit is meant to provide abstraction from underlying technologies (data storage, HTTP
server engines, etc.) to be able to change them with minimum impact.

It is designed to fit in applications that conform to the [Hexagonal Architecture] (also called
[Clean Architecture] or [Ports and Adapters Architecture]).

# Hello World

Simple Hello World HTTP example.

@sample hexagon_starters/src/main/kotlin/Service.kt

# Features

Hexagon's high-level features.

* [Simple to Use](/quick_start): Hexagon is focused in allowing you to use the features you use the
  most in your daily coding in the easiest way.

* [Easy to Hack](https://github.com/hexagonkt/hexagon/blob/master/contributing.md): The libraries
  are done to be lean and simple so you can tweak it to suit your needs instead relying on third
  parties.

* [Pluggable Adapters](/developer_guide): Adding an adapter is just implementing the port's
  interface. You can code your own adapters from scratch or tune the existing ones.

* [Kotlin First](http://kotlinlang.org): The library is coded in Kotlin for coding with Kotlin. No
  strings attached to Java (as a Language).

* [Properly Tested](https://github.com/hexagonkt/hexagon#status): Project's coverage is checked in
  every Pull Request. It is also stress tested at [TechEmpower Frameworks Benchmark][benchmark].

* [Modular](/developer_guide): Each feature is isolated in its own module. Use only the modules you
  need without unneeded dependencies.

# Architecture

How Hexagon fits in your architecture in a picture.

!!! Note
    Using this toolkit won't make your application compliant with Hexagonal Architecture (by its
    nature, no tool can do that), you have to provide a layer of abstraction by yourself.

Ports with their provided implementations (Adapters).
